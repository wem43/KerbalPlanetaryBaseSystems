    description = The Mediocre Advanced Logic (MAL) Landing Control Unit was invented by an engineer at K&K who though it was necessary to have a control unit to land things horizontally. He now can either be found in the asylum, or teaching new recruits. MAL is sometimes referred to as the "not so bright" cousin of HAL because it is made out of parts that did not pass the QA for HAL.
