# Kerbal Planetary Base Systems

Have you ever said "I don't want to live on this planet anymore"? Now you can! We at Kerman & Kerman  
Orbit and SurfaceStructures are proud to present you the all new product line for Kerbals who want  
nothing more than to live on another planet! We at Kerman & Kerman finally got out of the testing phase  
and now consider our parts to be usable.

This mod adds several new parts that are designed to be used in a planetery base for the Kerbals.This  
includes Habitats, Greenhouse, Laboratory, a Cupola derivative, Command-Center and others. It is  
designed to fit with the other stock parts and feel as "Kerbal" as possible.

### Looking for help:  
If anyone is interested to translate KPBS into Japanese ![](http://i.imgur.com/M93S44Z.png), Chinese ![](http://i.imgur.com/JyqfJ1P.png) ([in process](https://github.com/Nils277/KerbalPlanetaryBaseSystems/tree/master/Translation))  
(or the other languages that will be supported), please let me know! :) 

You can find all the texts that need translation here: [KPBS Texts](https://github.com/Nils277/KerbalPlanetaryBaseSystems/tree/master/Translation). (5916 Words)  

***Important***: Please contact me before you start with the translation. It already happend more than once that multiple
persons worked on a translation for the same texts and therefore their efforts were in vain.
